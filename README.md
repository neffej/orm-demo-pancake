## Description
The purpose of this project was ostensibly to allow an ecommerce site the ability to interface with their product database. However, the project's other purpose is to explore and display the abilities of MySQL and Sequelize to link API calls to database services.

## Installation
This project depends on Node.js, Express.js, the dotenv NPM package, and MySQL2 and Sequelize.  Please install these dependencies before interacting with the code. After install, you may clone the codebase to your local machine and be ready to go.

## Usage
Complete the steps above to acquire necessary technologies. Then:
*Open codebase with VS Code and type "npm i" to install and initialize the dependencies.  
*Set-up a .env file with your MySQL user name, password, and the ecommerce_db database. 
*Open the schema.sql file in the terminal and use MySQL commands to create the database in your machine.  
*Go back to your normal terminal interface and run node seeds/index.js to seed the data.  
*Run node server.js (or nodemon server.js if you have that installed) to get the server running.
*Interact with the database with Insomnia or some other API mimicking software
